```

### Why Local Runner?

LinkedIn blocks cloud servers (AWS, Vercel, etc.) because:
- Cloud IPs are flagged as bots
- No consistent device fingerprint
- Suspicious browser patterns

Running locally:
- Uses your home IP
- Maintains browser sessions
- Looks like normal usage
- Much safer from detection

## 🔧 Usage Guide

### Creating a Campaign

I'm reaching out because [your reason].

Would love to connect!

Best,
[Your name]
```

### Running the Automation

```bash
# Basic run
cd runner
node run-local.js

# Verify setup first
node verify-setup.js

# Create test campaign
node create-test-campaign.js
```

### Monitoring

- **Logs**: Check `runner/linkedin-runner.log`
- **Screenshots**: View `runner/screenshots/`
- **Dashboard**: Real-time updates at your-app.vercel.app

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Verify everything works
cd runner
node verify-setup.js

# Output should show:
# ✅ Environment variables set
# ✅ Database connected
# ✅ All tables exist
# ✅ Browser launches
# ✅ Directories created
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### LinkedIn Compliance
- Start with 10-15 messages/day
- Gradually increase over weeks
- Use during business hours
- Personalize every message
- Stop if you get warnings

### Session Management
- First run requires manual login
- Session saved for 30+ days
- Cookies stored in `linkedin-sessions/`
- Clear sessions to re-login

### Rate Limits
- 3-7 minutes between messages
- Daily limit enforced
- Respects recipient timezone
- Auto-pauses outside business hours

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### "No tasks in queue"
**Problem**: Runner shows this message repeatedly
**Solution**:
1. Create campaign in web UI
2. Upload CSV with contacts
3. Ensure campaign is active
4. Check database has task_queue entries

### "Login required every time"
**Problem**: Session not persisting
**Solution**:
1. Check `linkedin-sessions/` folder exists
2. Verify cookies.json is created after login
3. Check file permissions

### "Messages not sending"
**Problem**: Messages prepared but not sent
**Solution**:
1. Check you're connected to recipients
2. Verify LinkedIn UI hasn't changed
3. Review logs for specific errors
4. Try updating selectors

### "Database connection failed"
**Problem**: Cannot connect to Supabase
**Solution**:
1. Verify `.env` credentials are correct
2. Check Supabase service is running
3. Ensure tables were created via migration
4. Test with `node verify-setup.js`

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

- **Never commit `.env` files** - Add to .gitignore
- **Use service role key only in runner** - Never expose in frontend
- **Store sessions locally only** - Don't upload to cloud
- **Rotate credentials regularly** - Monthly recommended
- **Monitor for suspicious activity** - Check logs daily

## 📈 Scaling Options

### For Higher Volume

1. **Multiple LinkedIn Accounts**
   - Run separate runner instances
   - Use different `RUNNER_ID` for each
   - Separate session directories

2. **VPS Deployment** (24/7 Operation)
   ```bash
   # On DigitalOcean/AWS/etc ($5-10/month)
   ssh user@your-vps
   git clone [repo]
   cd linkedin-messenger/runner
   npm install
   # Configure .env
   node run-local.js
   ```

3. **Proxy Rotation** (Advanced)
   - Use residential proxies
   - Rotate every few hours
   - Match target geography

## 🛠️ Development

### Running Tests
```bash
cd runner
npm test                    # Run test suite
node verify-setup.js       # Verify configuration
```

### Adding New Features
1. Database changes go in `supabase/migrations/`
2. UI changes in `app/` directory
3. Runner logic in `runner/` directory
4. Shared code in `packages/`

### Debugging
- Enable debug mode: `DEBUG=* node run-local.js`
- Check screenshots: `runner/screenshots/`
- Review logs: `runner/linkedin-runner.log`
- Database queries: Supabase dashboard

## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Warm Up Account**: Start with 5 messages/day, increase by 5 weekly
2. **Personalization Wins**: Use actual details about recipients
3. **Timing Matters**: Tuesday-Thursday, 10 AM-2 PM best
4. **Follow Up**: 2-3 follow-ups increase response 3x
5. **A/B Test**: Try different templates, measure results
6. **Stay Human**: Add typos occasionally, vary timing
